## Description

_This website has the user input one number and one name. It then uses the number inputted to create an array from zero to the inputted number. It follows the specs below:_

         ----From Most Important to Least Important----

      ~If the user input is above 150, then custom text is outputted instead of the calculated Array.
      ~Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "userName + ", Would you like a glass of motor oil?""
      ~Numbers that contain a 1 are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
      ~Numbers that contain a 0 are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
      ~Numbers that contain a 5 are replaced (all digits) with "ERROR PROTOCOL, HUMAN INPUT"

_After creating the new array, it then outputs it to the user._

_The reset button clears the existing array and form and let's the user input a new value or name._
